Net present value (NPV) is an investment measure that tells an investor whether the investment is achieving a target yield at a given initial investment.


## Distinction between NPV vs IRR
REF: https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/the-difference-between-npv-and-irr.html

- Outcome
    - The NPV method results in a dollar value that a project will produce
    - IRR generates the percentage return that the project is expected to create.

- Purpose
    - The NPV method focuses on project surpluses
    - IRR is focused on the breakeven cash flow level of a project.

- Decision support
    - The NPV method presents an outcome that forms the foundation for an investment decision, since it presents a dollar return.
    - The IRR method does not help in making this decision, since its percentage return does not tell the investor how much money will be made.

- Reinvestment rate
    - NPV is used, while it is the internal rate of return under the IRR method.
    - The presumed rate of return for the reinvestment of intermediate cash flows is the firm's cost of capital

- Discount rate issues
    - The NPV method requires the use of a discount rate, which can be difficult to derive, since management might want to adjust it based on perceived risk levels
    - The IRR method does not have this difficulty, since the rate of return is simply derived from the underlying cash flows.

- Generally, NPV is the more heavily-used method. IRR tends to be calculated as part of the capital budgeting process and supplied as additional information.
